    <h1>LunarRED Assembly</h1>
    <p>
      This is the website for the LRA Language. LRA is a simple Assembly-style
      language designed for ease of use, as well as a language meant for speed,
      requiring little to no memory allocation due to everything being allocated
      for you.

    <h1>NexFUSE</h1>
    <p>
      LunarRED has full ABI compatibility with NexFUSE, having first-class
      access to subroutines, functionality, and memory. NexFUSE is a
      high-profile bytecode format that contains a register-based virtual
      machine.
      
      <br>

      NexFUSE supports 32-bit and 64-bit systems, and has been tested on macOS,
      Windows, Linux, and Android.
