lunarred assembler - a lightweight assembly language for the OpenLUD and NexFUSE
bytecode formats

sample program (for those of you who don't want to open the source):

    # always initialize registers that your program may use
    # if you don't your program may have unexpected behavior
    # one-letter subroutine names are allowed in NexFUSE but not OpenLUD
    # in the future, there may be fewer restrictions and multiple-letter
    # subroutines will be allowed
    @M:
    # move 0x42 into R1
        mov R1, 0x42
        null

    # move newline into R1
        mov R1, 0x0a
        null
        
    # output each byte in R1
        each R1
        null

    # signal end of program
        halt
