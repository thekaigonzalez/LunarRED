bytecode formats

LunarRED

    An entirely open-source assembly language for the OpenLUD and NexFUSE
    bytecode formats, with little to no overhead.

    LunarRED is not a language itself, it is a compiler, the language that is
    translated into bytecode is called LR Assembly (LunarRED Assembly). LunarRED
    assembly follows very similar conventions to other assemblers, except the
    learning curve for past assembly developers may be much steeper than
    anticipated.
    
    LunarRED comments start with '#', and comments are not allowed on the same
    line as any code.
